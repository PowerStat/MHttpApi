# PowerStat's MHttpApi

This is a Java implementation of the Mobotix Http API.

See:

* [Mobotix Camera HTTP API](https://developer.mobotix.com/)

## Installation

Because this library is only useful for developers the installation depends on your build environment.

For example when using Apache Maven you could add the following dependency to your project:

      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    </dependency>

Other build tools like gradle will work analogous.
